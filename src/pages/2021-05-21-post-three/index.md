As I learn React and Javascript more and more I find the best way to really understand concepts is practice. Like anything else in life this profession is muscle memory and the more I practice the more I understand. I've always wanted to understand both the logic and the "under-the-hood" side of how games work, even the most simple ones.

So that ended up being my starting point, Tic Tac Toe. Building a React based Tic Tac Toe really helped me to understand further the practical uses of state management and how it can it be combined with logic to really do just about anything you want. In a day I was able to build out a fully functioned version of this game, there was some great tutorials out there that helped me along the way and for anyone looking to build their first game this one was a lot of fun!

For now,  
Chris
