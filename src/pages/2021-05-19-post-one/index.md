First of all I have to say this is my first blog post! Being able to publish this on a site I developed is really something I'm proud of. Less then 10 months ago I hadnt even thought of this journey, let alone understand even the simpliest of HTML tags it would take to get here. But after so much change last year, a little bit of luck and the most work I've ever put into anything, here it is. My own site, my own blog, built my yours truly. I know I'm not being very humble but there's been alot of emotion throughout this process, equally high and low, at this point being able to celebrate finally feels ok!

I decided to take on a new challenge for my personal portfolio with GatsbyJS. This has proven to be a rewarding and highly educational experience. Coming from a strict create-react-app background there are many positives to Gatsby and I look forward to discussing those in a future post.

For now its time to celebrate this accomplishment...and work on some CSS. Thanks to all those who helped with this process but no bigger thanks then to my parents, they have supported me no matter what without question and for what I'm forever grateful.

For now,  
Chris
