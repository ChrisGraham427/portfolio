title: "What I Learned With My First Gatsby Site - A Beginners Perspective"
author: "Chris Graham"
---

Ok, so I'll be honest Ive never built anything outside of create-react-app. I decided as a challenge to myself I would learn a new framework but didnt want to completely reinvent the wheel as I'm still cementing my skills with CRA. So after lots of YouTube videos and some discussion with peers I decided to give GatsbyJS a try.  
Gatsby has proven to be simple, easy to pick up (the routing aspect alone is **wonderful**), and FAST. The speed difference when loading in the browser is noticeable with the naked eye, let alone performance scores. This alone makes working with Gatsby for simple static sites a huge upgrade over CRA. Not sure if I mentioned this but we are talking static sites here because thats what Gatsby is, a react based static site generator that utlitizes webpack and graphQL(mainly). Also there appears to be alot of SEO friendly upgrades and I know it was heavily discussed as an advantage. Myself and another dev are currenntly building Me & Ma's e-commerce platform with Gatsby so we will be learning lots about the SEO capabilities as we go so I will definitely do a rant on that at some point as well. Overall, the ease of use and speed make this a great alternative for any beginner dev's to crank out static sites quickly. I really look forward to exploring GatsbyJS further and unravel more of its capabilites

For now,  
Chris
